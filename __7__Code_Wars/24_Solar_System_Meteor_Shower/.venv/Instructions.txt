Oh no! The planets are jumbled up!
TASK

Given the Solar System in the form of a list, you have to return the Solar System (as a list) after the "Meteoroid"s have stopped smashing into the planets.

The Solar System can have 2 types of celestial bodies.

    "Meteoroids"s
    Small solid planets, which are: ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars"]

The direction of the "Meteoroid" will depend on the arrow, for example, "Meteoroid>" is moving to the right, but "<Meteoroid" is moving to the left. All "Meteoroid"s will have an arrow, either pointing to the left or the right.

The small solid planets' sizes are denoted with brackets, for example, "(((Mars)))" is bigger than "(Venus)". The planets can also have no brackets, like just "Earth".

A "Meteoroid" crosses another "Meteoroid" without changing anything, and continues to go onward.

If a moving "Meteoroid" goes out of the list, it has to be simply removed from the Solar System.

Now, each time a moving "Meteoroid" hits a planet, it breaks, but the planet it hit loses one pair of brackets.

If a "Meteoroid" hits a planet without any brackets (or with all its brackets removed by other "Meteoroid"s), then both the planet and the "Meteoroid" break.
EXAMPLE

Given the Solar System: ["<Meteoroid", "Meteoroid>", "Meteoroid>", "((Mercury))", "Meteoroid>", "Mars", "<Meteoroid", "Meteoroid>", "((Earth))"]

You start with the first "<Meteoroid".

"<Meteoroid" moves to the left, and straight away goes out of orbit.

Solar System: ["Meteoroid>", "Meteoroid>", "((Mercury))", "Meteoroid>", "Mars", "<Meteoroid", "Meteoroid>", "((Earth))"]

"Meteoroid>" starts to move, crosses another "Meteoroid>", smashes into "((Mercury))", gets destroyed but reduces "(Mercury)" to just one pair of brackets.

Solar System: ["Meteoroid>", "(Mercury)", "Meteoroid>", "Mars", "<Meteoroid", "Meteoroid>", "((Earth))"]

Next, the second "Meteoroid>" moves. It smashes into "(Mercury)" and breaks. Now Mercury is just "Mercury".

Solar System: ["Mercury", "Meteoroid>", "Mars", "<Meteoroid", "Meteoroid>", "((Earth))"]

Mercury can't move and change things, so we move onto the next Meteoroid, which is "Meteoroid>". It moves and smashes into a bracket-less and unprotected "Mars". Both the "Meteoroid" and "Mars" are be destroyed.

Solar System: ["Mercury", "<Meteoroid", "Meteoroid>", "((Earth))"]

Now it's the next Meteoroid, who is moving towards the left. Directly towards poor, battle-worn Mercury! Mercury has no brackets, so both get destroyed!

Solar System: ["Meteoroid>", "((Earth))"]

"Meteoroid>" moves towards "((Earth))" and smashes into it. The "Meteoroid" breaks, but "(Earth)" only loses a pair of brackets.

Solar System: ["(Earth)"]

Now that the "(Earth)" is not going anywhere and everything's done. You have to return the new Solar System, ["(Earth)"].
NOTES

    As all "Meteoroid"s move forever, they will either go out of orbit or will break themselves. So the Solar System you return should not have any"Meteoroid"s.
    Planets may or may not have brackets
    There will never be more then one of anything except "Meteoroid"s
    All the names of the celestial bodies in the Solar System will be title-cased
