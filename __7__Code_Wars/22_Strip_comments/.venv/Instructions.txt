Given an input string of:

apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples

The output expected would be:

apples, pears
grapes
bananas

The code would be called like so:

result = strip_comments("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"])
# result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
