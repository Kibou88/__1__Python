Background:

As in standard chess, in the starting position the 2nd and 7th rank contain pawns and the remaining white/black
pieces are on the 1st/8th rank. What changes is that the pieces on the first rank can be placed anywhere,
as long as the two bishops are on different colored squares and the king is placed between the two rooks.
The configuration of the 8th rank matches the 1st rank, so that white and black start in the same position.

There are a total of 960 possible starting positions, hence the name. If these positions are sorted
lexicographically, we can associate each integer from 1 to 960 with a specific Chess960 starting position.
Task:

Given a positive integer i between 1 and 960, return a string representing the board in the i'th Chess960
starting position. The pieces are denoted using queen -> Q, rook -> R, king -> K, knight -> N, bishop -> B
and pawn -> P, with lowercase letters representing black and uppercase white. "." is used for empty squares.
"\n" should terminate each row, including the last.
Examples:

i = 1 => "b b n n q r k r\np p p p p p p p\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\nP P P P P P P P\nB B N N Q R K R\n"

When printed:

b b n n q r k r
p p p p p p p p
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . .
P P P P P P P P
B B N N Q R K R

i = 960 => "r q n n k r b b\np p p p p p p p\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\nP P P P P P P P\nR Q N N K R B B\n"

When printed:

r q n n k r b b
p p p p p p p p
. . . . . . . .
